#    file_sync.shl
#      used to sync the fmx directory across all of the INB servers
#
#      NOTES:
#        1) forms will be compiled on one server and then by using this
#           rsync command the files will be in sync across servers
#        2) rsync is smart enough to figure out if files have changed
#        3) the --delete flag will remove files from the dest server if
#           they are no longer on the source server
#        4) this only works without a password prompt if keys are shared
#         
#        INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHARING KEYS:
#          a) log in to source machine (i.e. usfdev2)
#          b) from the home directory (cd ~) type:
#               ssh-keygen -t rsa
#                 NOTE: accept the defaults when prompted with questions
#                       by just hitting enter
#          c) this command will create a file called ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
#          d) copy this file to each server that will be synced:
#               scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub usfdev3:/home/{user_name}
#          e) from the remote server, copy the contents of id_rsa.pub to 
#             ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with the next 2 commands:
#               cat ~/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
#               chmod 700 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys  
#          f) now this script should be able to be run without a password
